    "description": "Slightly shorter than the rest, and don’t mention it—she’s sensitive about her height. Fireproof, but not lava-proof. Rain and water are her kryptonite, slowing her down and making her drown faster. Post-water movement is sluggish. Can shatter stone with her pickaxe-like paws. Bonus HP and a strict carnivore—she prefers meat but can tolerate veggies in a pinch. With a Nether Star, she evolves, unlocking new strength and abilities.",
