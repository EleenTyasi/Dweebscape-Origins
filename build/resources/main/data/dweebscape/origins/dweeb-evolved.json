Night vision in the End, faster speeds under the night sky, and enhanced powers in colder biomes. Berries remain a favorite, boosting their abilities. Still sensitive to heat and exhaustion in the Nether. Now at full strength, Dweeb’s powers reach their peak—stay out of the sun and embrace the night.",
