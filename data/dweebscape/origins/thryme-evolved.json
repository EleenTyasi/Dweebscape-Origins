    "description": "Strengthened after entering the End, this insectoid-feline now delivers even more lethal strikes. Spines deal increased damage but only when Manticore is above 50% HP. Poison strikes have evolved into the more dangerous Wither effect. Immune to poison and wither, they retain their bug-like allies and night vision. With reinforced claws and sharper instincts, they are ready to face greater challenges.",
