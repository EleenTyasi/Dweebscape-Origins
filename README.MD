# We actually makin' a mod here. 
# Dweebscape: Eleen Origins

Dunno what else to say, but each power is made by myself; with minor revisionaries by Luna Aura
to make it best fit for Lunar Origins Core.
Nine seperate origins, with a lot of powers that.... are one heck of a mess.
Dunno how else to put it, but I enjoy writing mods.

Here be spagetti code. You've been *warned*, gamer.
I know NOTHING about how any of this code works, but I guess it kinda does?
Most items in this addon will not have function, and are meant to be used in the icons.
Wow.
